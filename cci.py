'''Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
   CCI = (Typical price â€“ MA of Typical price) / (0.015 * Standard deviation of Typical price)
   A bullish divergence occurs when the underlying security makes a lower low and the CCI forms a higher low, 
   which shows less downside momentum. Similarly, a bearish divergence is formed when the security records 
   a higher high and the CCI forms a lower high, which shows less upside momentum.
